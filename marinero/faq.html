            <p>You should avoid our meats (obviously). Our cheese is made with a vegetable-based rennet, and our sour cream is 100% cultured cream. If your own personal vegetarian guidelines therefore allow you to eat these dairy items, then that's terrific. If not, then you should avoid them.

          <h3>What is a GMO?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>A genetically modified organism (GMO) is created by inserting genes from one species (typically bacteria or a virus) into the DNA of another. This results in a plant with characteristics that wouldn’t occur naturally, such as producing pesticides or the ability to withstand high doses of chemical herbicides.<br>
<br>
Currently, GMO varieties of 8 crops are cultivated in the U.S. at commercial scale. These are:<br>
<br>
    •    Corn<br>
    •    Canola<br>
    •    Soy<br>
    •    Cotton<br>

          <h3>Which ingredients in the food served at Chipotle were previously genetically modified?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>Of the eight common GMO crops grown in the U.S., only two were found as ingredients in Chipotle’s food prior to our move to non-GMO ingredients: corn and soy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Corn.</strong> GMO corn flour, corn starch, and a small number of other corn-based ingredients were used in Chipotle’s corn and flour tortillas. We have worked with our tortilla suppliers to remove these ingredients or replace them with non-GMO versions. The white sweet corn in Chipotle’s Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa has always been a non-GMO variety of corn.<br>
<br>
<strong>Soy.</strong> GMO soybean oil was an ingredient in our flour tortillas and used as a cooking oil in our restaurants. Our restaurants now cook with Sunflower Oil and Rice Bran Oil. Our tortillas are now made with non-GMO Canola oil (while canola is often genetically modified, the canola oil in Chipotle tortillas is non-GMO). The organic soybeans used to make the tofu in our Sofritas have always been non-GMO, like all certified organic ingredients.</p>

          <h3>Why did Chipotle decide to use non-GMO ingredients in its food?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>As part of Chipotle’s commitment to serving Food With Integrity, we believe that the food we serve should be made with ingredients raised with care for animals, farmers, and the environment. We’re doubtful that the GMO ingredients that used to be in our food meet these criteria. Here are the three key reasons.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
<strong>Scientists are still studying the long term implications of GMOs.</strong> While some studies have shown GMOs to be safe, most of this research was funded by companies that sell GMO seeds and did not evaluate long-term effects. More independent studies are needed.<br>
	<br>
	The chemical industry claims that GMOs are widely considered to be safe, but the scientific community has not yet reached a consensus on the long-term implications of widespread GMO cultivation and consumption. For example, in October 2013 a group of about 300 scientists from around the world signed a statement rejecting the claim that there is a scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs for human consumption. These scientists would like to see more research conducted, and they’d like more of the research to be conducted by independent third parties, not the companies marketing GMO crops themselves. Until such studies are conducted, we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach toward GMOs.<br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>The cultivation of GMOs can damage the environment.</strong> Evidence suggests that GMOs engineered to produce pesticides or withstand powerful chemical herbicides damage beneficial insect populations and create herbicide resistant super-weeds.<br>
	<br>
	The companies that sell GMO seeds claim that genetically modified crops are better for the environment because they reduce the amount of pesticides and herbicides used in farming. But this has not been shown to be the case. One recent study by researchers at Washington State University estimated that between 1996 and 2011, pesticide and herbicide use increased by more than 400 million pounds as a result of GMO cultivation. This and other evidence suggests that GMO crops are fueling an escalating chemical arms race with weeds and insects.<br>
	 </li>
	<li>
<strong>Chipotle should be a place where people who choose to avoid GMOs can still enjoy eating.</strong> In our quest to serve the best ingredients, we decided to replace the few GMO ingredients we were using in our food with non-GMO alternatives so that our customers who choose to avoid GMOs can enjoy eating at Chipotle.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the last 21 years, Chipotle has been making high-quality whole ingredients prepared using classic cooking techniques accessible to all. To that end, we want our customers to have access to ingredients that have not been genetically modified.</p>

          <h3>Do the meat and dairy products at Chipotle contain GMOs?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>The meat and dairy products we buy come from animals that are not genetically modified. But it is important to note that most animal feed in the U.S. is genetically modified, which means that the meat and dairy served at Chipotle are likely to come from animals given at least some GMO feed. We are working hard on this challenge, and have made substantial progress: for example, the 100% grass-fed beef served in many Chipotle restaurants was not fed GMO grain—or any grain, for that matter. This is an important start, but we recognize that sourcing meat and dairy exclusively from animals never fed GMOs would be a long-term project that would represent further progress in this area.</p>

          <h3>Is the cheese Chipotle serves made with GMO enzymes?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>Most cheese makers in the U.S., including those who supply cheese to Chipotle, use what is called Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC), which is a vegetarian rennet that is classified as non-GMO by the EU and all existing U.S. state GMO labeling laws. While this enzyme is non-GMO, it is produced by bacteria that have been genetically modified. During the production process, the enzyme used to make cheese is completely separated from these organisms and does not contain any GMO material. The bacteria are classified as “processing aids” because they are not used as ingredients to make cheese. For this reason, cheese made with FPC enzyme does not contain any GMO material. All of our cheese suppliers provide us with documentation of the non-GMO status of the enzyme used to make cheese for Chipotle.</p>

          <h3>Does Chipotle’s recent announcement apply to processing aids in addition to food ingredients?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            No. While all of the ingredients we use to make the food we serve—such as the corn flour in our corn tortillas, or the organic tofu in our Sofritas—are non-GMO, some of our suppliers may use processing aids that contain GMO material.<br>
<br>
The FDA defines “processing aids” as:
<ol>
	<li>Substances that are added to a food during the processing of such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is packaged in its finished form.</li>
	<li>Substances that are added to a food during processing, are converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not significantly increase the amount of the constituents naturally found in the food.</li>
	<li>Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.</li>
</ol>
Processing aids aren’t additives like preservatives, colors, or flavors, which are required to be included on ingredient lists. Instead, they are substances that serve a specific purpose in food production, but either do not appear in the finished food or are present at insignificant levels in the finished food. Fruit and vegetable washes are a good example of a processing aid. We use fruit and vegetable wash to clean the produce we serve in Chipotle restaurants, and some of our produce suppliers use fruit and vegetable washes in the process of packing produce.<br>
<br>
Some of the food producers who supply Chipotle may use various processing aids that contain GMO material or are produced by genetically modified organisms.

          <h3>How does Chipotle know your ingredients are non-GMO?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>When we decided in 2013 to disclose the GMO ingredients in our food, we undertook a comprehensive review of all of our ingredients to identify those that were likely to be genetically modified. Most of the ingredients we serve—such as jalapeño peppers, red onions, cilantro, and pinto beans—have not been approved for commercial use in genetically modified form in the U.S. In other words, these ingredients can be safely presumed to be non-GMO. In cases where ingredients in our food do exist in genetically modified form, we have moved to non-GMO alternatives. To get assurance of the non-GMO status of those alternatives, we’ve used ingredients that are organically grown (since intentional use of GMOs is not permitted for organic growers), and/or obtained documentation from the ingredient suppliers attesting to their use of non-GMO ingredients. We also ensure that certain ingredients are tested periodically for the presence of GMOs. In some cases, such as sunflower oil, we use ingredients verified as non-GMO by the Non-GMO Project.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that these protocols may not necessarily result in all of our foods being 100% GMO-free. Due to the potential for cross-contamination in fields, facilities or during shipping, it may be that trace amounts of GMOs are present in our food from time to time. For this reason, we identify our ingredients as “non-GMO” rather than “GMO-free” or other terminology that might be misunderstood as a guarantee of absolutely zero genetically engineered content. The United States currently lacks a regulatory definition for “non-GMO” or similar terminology, but private organizations in the U.S. as well as the European Union have put forth standards that allow for food labeled as non-GMO to contain trace amounts (typically up to 0.9%) of genetically modified material.</p>

          <h3>Isn’t Chipotle contributing to unnecessary hysteria about GMOs?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>When Chipotle first started talking about GMOs, it was in the context of transparency—we were the first large restaurant company to disclose the fact that there were GMOs in our food, and commit to switching to non-GMO alternatives. Now, we want people to understand more about GMOs, whether they are in our food or not. We believe people should be interested in the food they eat and where it comes from, and make choices that make sense for them and their families.<br>
<br>
There are real concerns about the health and environmental impacts of GMO foods. People can debate this topic, but those who have looked into the issue know that it is extremely complex. We believe the implications of growing and eating GMOs must be studied more by independent scientists who do not have an incentive to produce particular results. What we do know is that some of the chemicals and toxins used in GMO cultivation have caused health and environmental issues, and that is at the very least a reason to be cautious. Caution and hysteria are not the same thing.</p>

          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">

<br>
While we are committed to sourcing non-GMO ingredients, Chipotle respects the right of every farmer, rancher and grower to follow practices that make sense for their business, even if they do not make sense for ours. Just as we believe that consumers have the right to know what’s in their food and avoid ingredients they choose to, farmers have the right to grow whichever crops they choose.</p>

          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            <p>You need to achieve a STATUS LEVEL in order to earn most rewards. Status levels are achieved by making purchases of at least $6 before tax (and excluding alcohol and gift cards), but only once per day. For example, you need to purchase at least four entrées on four different days within the the same month to achieve MILD STATUS, which earns you a free entrée. Easy and awesome. Then, by coming more times that same month, you can earn even higher status levels and more free entrées. Still easy, more awesome.

            <p>Yes! You can redeem entrée rewards earned in Chiptopia to help you achieve the next level.

So pick whichever option works best for you, then go ahead and order that. In some areas, we offer limited Catering, so Burritos by the Box is the only option.</p>

          <h3>Chiptopia: If I've achieved HOT Bonus Reward (FREE Catering for 20), how do I best redeem my delicious, awesomerest reward?</h3>


          <div class="faq-question__answer js-faqAnswer">
            Start by checking your My Rewards section in your account at <a href="chiptopia.html">chipotle.com/chiptopia</a> to confirm the status of your reward. Then just visit <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/catering">www.chipotle.com/catering</a> for Chipotle Catering details, including what options are available for your area. When you're ready to order, call 1-800-Chipotle to place your order at least 24-hours in advance of your event or party—however we suggest that you order at least 7 days in advance when possible. Then, when you come in to pick up your catering at the location listed on your catering order confirmation, just present your Chiptopia card to be swiped or scanned at the time of checkout.  It's that easy, and so very delicious.
